# finance_credit_risk_model
This project is based on historical credit data from a bank in Spain.

The goal of the resulting Machine Learning model is to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on their loan given the presented historical characterists.

The process consists of EDA, visualization, Feature engineering, running ML algorithms on the transformed data and then using grid search to find the optimal parameters.

This project achieved the best roc auc score in the financial analytics Master's class at IE University with 50 people.
